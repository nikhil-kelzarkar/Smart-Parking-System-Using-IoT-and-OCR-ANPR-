# Smart-Parking-System-Using-IoT-and-OCR-ANPR-
Smart Parking System Using IoT and OCR (ANPR) ESP32, Python, Tesseract OCR, SQLite, Embedded C Designed a smart parking system using a custom ESP32 PCB with PIR sensors and servo gate control. Integrated OCR for number plate recognition, real-time slot monitoring via web dashboard, and automated access using Python-ESP32 communication.

ESP32, Python, Tesseract OCR, SQLite, Embedded C

Developed a smart parking system using a custom ESP32 PCB with PIR sensors, servo control, and ultrasonic triggering.

Implemented ANPR using Python and Tesseract OCR to automate gate access based on vehicle number verification.

Created a real-time web dashboard for live parking slot status and logged unknown entries with timestamp.
